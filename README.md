# The Hubbard Model

I replicated some parts of [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.2259) by Claveau et al (2014) for CHEM-5555 in Spring 2025.

I decided to return to this project to see if I could study the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with the software I had. See some of my results in `figures_ssh/`! 

I have a growing interest in topological insulators, so also played around with Floquet drives with a pure SSH model.
