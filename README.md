# The Hubbard Model

I replicated some parts of [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.2259) by Claveau et al (2014) for CHEM-5555 in Spring 2025.

08/2025:

I decided to return to this project to see if I could study the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with the software I already had. See some relevant plots in `figures_ssh/`

also vibecoded a floquet drive addition to the hamiltonian. not sure how accurate my results are so should return to this
